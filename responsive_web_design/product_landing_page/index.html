                    <p class="yoga-exp">In a Hatha Yoga class, you move in a gentle way. The hatha yoga postures are 
                        designed to cultivate strength, flexibility, openness, balance, and relaxation. The classes typically consist of 50% active poses and 50% relaxing poses. Practising Hatha Yoga on a regular basis will allow prana (life force) to flow freely, reduce anxiety and stress, 
                        invite steadiness of breathing, clarity of mind, improve circulation and flexibility.</p>

                    <p class="yoga-exp">Yin Yoga combines aspects of Hatha Yoga, the concept of the meridians in Chinese medicine, 
                        Taoist philosophy and Buddhist meditation techniques. By holding the postures in a seated or lying position 
                        for 3 - 5 minutes, it directs the stimulation deeper into connective tissues, such as ligaments, bones, and 
                        the joints of the body. When practised regularly, Yin Yoga increases the flexibility, circulation, and
                         range of motion in the joints and ligaments. In the class, you will find yourself relaxing from ‘the perfection’ 
                        of the world and enjoying the presence ‘as it is being mindful of your current state.</p>

                    <p class="yoga-exp">In Vinyasa Yoga, you experience a flow from pose to pose, 
                        linked together by the breath. During this practice, you will smoothly transition through a unique 
                        sequence, building physical strength, endurance, and flexibility. We offer Vinyasa for beginners, but also
                         have multiple options for intermediate 
                        or advanced practitioners who want to deepen and develop their practice.</p>
