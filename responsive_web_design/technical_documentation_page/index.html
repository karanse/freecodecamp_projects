                <p>Bootstrap is a powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build anything—from prototype to production—in minutes.</p>
                <p>Get started by including Bootstrap’s production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN without the need for any build steps. 
                    See it in practice with this <a href="https://codepen.io/team/bootstrap/pen/qBamdLj">Bootstrap CodePen demo.</a></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> 
                            tag as well for proper responsive behavior in mobile devices.</li>
                        <li>Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS. Place the &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; for our CSS, and the &lt;script&gt; 
                            tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing &lt;/body&gt;. 
                            Learn more about our CDN links.</li>
                        <li>Hello, world! Open the page in your browser of choice to see your Bootstrapped page. 
                            Now you can start building with Bootstrap by creating your own layout, adding dozens of 
                            components, and utilizing our official examples.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>Download Bootstrap to get the compiled CSS and JavaScript, source code, or include it with your favorite package managers like npm, RubyGems, and more.</p>
                <h3>Compiled CSS and JS</h3>
                <p>Download ready-to-use compiled code for Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha1 to easily drop into your project, which includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compiled and minified CSS bundles</li>
                        <li>Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Source Files</h3>
                <p>Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sass compiler for compiling Sass source files into CSS files</li>
                        <li>Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing</li>
                    </ul>
                    Should you require our full set of build tools, they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes
                </p>
                <h3>npm</h3>
                <code>npm install bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1</code>
                <h3>yarn</h3>
                <code>yarn add bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1</code>

                <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
                <p>Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.</p>
                <h4>Core concepts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.</strong> 
                        Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.</strong> 
                        Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. 
                        We most commonly use min-width in our media queries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.</strong> 
                        Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. 
                        This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These breakpoints are customizable via Sass—you’ll find them in a Sass map in our _variables.scss stylesheet.</p>
                <code>$grid-breakpoints: (
                    xs: 0,
                    sm: 576px,
                    md: 768px,
                    lg: 992px,
                    xl: 1200px,
                    xxl: 1400px
                  );</code>
                <h3>Columns</h3>
                <p>Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment, ordering, and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system. 
                    Plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.</p>
                <h4>How they work</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Columns build on the grid’s flexbox architecture. </strong>
                        Flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and modifying groups of columns at the row level. 
                        You choose how columns grow, shrink, or otherwise change.</li>
                    <li><strong>When building grid layouts, all content goes in columns. </strong>The hierarchy of Bootstrap’s grid goes from container to row to column to your content. On rare occasions, you may combine content and column, 
                        but be aware there can be unintended consequences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bootstrap includes predefined classes for creating fast, responsive layouts.</strong> 
                        With six breakpoints and a dozen columns at each grid tier, we have dozens of classes already built for you to create your desired layouts. 
                        This can be disabled via Sass if you wish.</li>

                <h3>Reboot</h3>
                <p>Reboot, a collection of element-specific CSS changes in a single file, 
                    kickstart Bootstrap to provide an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon.</p>
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated 
                    styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is 
                    done only with classes. For example, we reboot some &lt;table&gt; styles 
                    for a simpler baseline and later provide .table, .table-bordered, and more.</p>
                <p>Here are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override in Reboot: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Update some browser default values to use rems instead of ems for scalable component spacing.</li>
                    <li>Avoid margin-top. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of margin is a simpler mental model.</li>
                    <li>For easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use rems for margins.</li>
                    <li>Keep declarations of font-related properties to a minimum, using inherit whenever possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>CSS Variables</h4>
                <p>With v5.1.1, we standardized our required @imports across all our CSS bundles 
                    (including bootstrap.css, bootstrap-reboot.css, and bootstrap-grid.css) to include _root.scss. 
                    This adds :root level CSS variables to all bundles, regardless of how many of them are used in 
                    that bundle. Ultimately Bootstrap 5 will continue to see more CSS variables added over time, 
                    in order to provide more real-time customization without the need to always recompile Sass. 
                    Our approach is to take our source Sass variables and transform them into CSS variables. 
                    That way, even if you don’t use CSS variables, you still have all the power of Sass. 
                    This is still in-progress and will take time to fully implement.</p>

                <h3>Accordion</h3>
                <p>Build vertically collapsing accordions in combination with our Collapse JavaScript plugin.</p>
                <p>The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion that’s expanded, add the <code>.open</code>  class on the <code>.accordion</code>.</p>
                <h3>Navbar</h3>
                <p>Documentation and examples for Bootstrap’s powerful, responsive navigation header, the navbar. 
                    Includes support for branding, navigation, and more, including support for our collapse plugin.</p>
                <p>Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navbars require a wrapping <code>.navbar</code> with <code>.navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl}</code>  for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.</li>
                    <li>Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Change the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways.</li>
                    <li> Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.</li>
                    <li>Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Dropdowns</h3>
                <p>Toggle contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more with the Bootstrap dropdown plugin.</p>
                <p>Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. They’re made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. 
                    They’re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.</p>
                <p>Dropdowns are built on a third party library, Popper, which provides dynamic positioning and viewport detection.
                     Be sure to include <code>popper.min.js</code>  before Bootstrap’s JavaScript or use <code>bootstrap.bundle.min.js / bootstrap.bundle.js</code>  which contains Popper. 
                    Popper isn’t used to position dropdowns in navbars though as dynamic positioning isn’t required.</p>
                <h3>Buttons</h3>
                <p>Use Bootstrap’s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.</p>
                <p>If you don’t want the button text to wrap, you can add the <code>.text-nowrap</code>  class to the button. In Sass, you can set <code>$btn-white-space: nowrap</code> to disable text wrapping for each button.</p>
